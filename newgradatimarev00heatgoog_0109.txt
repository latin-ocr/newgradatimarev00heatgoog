THE ARGONAUTS.

THE ARGONAUTS.

The celebrated voyage oi the Argonauts was brought about

as follows. Pelias had expelled his brother Aeson lrom his
kingdom in Thessaly and had attempted to take the life of
Jason, the son oi Aeson. Jason, however, escaped and grew
up to manhood in another country. At last he returned to
Thessaly, and Pelias, fearing that he might attempt to recover
, the kingdom, sent him to fetch the Golden Fleece lrom
Colchis, supposing this to be an impossible feat. Jason with a
band of heroes started in the ship Argo (called after Argus, its
builder), and after many adventures reached Colchis Here
AeeteS, king of Colchis, who was unwilling to give up the
F leece, set Jason to perform what seemed an impossible task,
via, to plough a field with certain fire-breathing oxen and then
to sow it with dragon's teeth. Medea, the daughter of the
king, however, assisted Jason by her skill in magic, first to
perform the task appointed, and then to procure the F leece.
Medea then fled with Jason, and, in order to delay the pursuit
of her father, sacrificed her brother Absyrtus. After reaching
Thessaly, Medea caused the death of Pelias, and waS, with her
husband, expelled from Thessaly. They removed to Corinth,
and here Medea, becoming jealousof Glauce, daughter oi
Creon, caused her death by means of a poisoned robe. After
this Medea was carried off in a chariot sent by the sun-god,
and Jason was soon afterwards accidentally killed.
