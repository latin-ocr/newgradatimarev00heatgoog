TRANSI TI VE VERBS.

TRANSITIVE VERBS.

But when an action affects some person or thing
besides the doer the verb is called transitive, because
the action passer across from the doer to the other
person or thing, and this latter is put into the
accusative case.

RULE 2.—When used transitively‚ verbs govern
the accusative case.

r. perieulum videbitne you will see danger.
2. tlmfimus lupum, we sear the wolf.
3. amicda advocamua we call to friends.

⁸ 4. intr& aquam'l enter tlte water.

SUBJECT. PREDICATE.

1. puer taurum vulnerabit, tlte bey will wound the bull.
z. taurus vulnerat puerum, tlte bull wounds tlte bey.

3. magister puellam doossblt, tlte master will teaclz tlte girl.
4. iosuae agr& terminant, ditches bound tltefields.

12. Care must be taken not to confuse the accusa-
tive case with the dative. These are easily confused ι
in English, since the preposition to, which is the
sign of the dative, is frequently left out.

RULE 3.— The dative is the case oi the recipient,
or the person (or thing) who is interested in an
action but does not actually suffer it.
