96 CUM CAUSAL OR CONCESSIVE.

45. Notice that the subjunctives sis and essemus
are translated by the indicative. The dependent
clauses are called indirect questions, lor they repre·

sent quis es? and ubi eramus?
46. Indirect questions begin with an interrogative
word and have the verb in the subjunctive.

corr cnusnr„ ori concusswa.

4⁷. Cum sometimes means as or sima· some·
times though. When it has either of these two
meanings it is followed by the subjunctive.

1. cum amici adsint. gaudemus since our friends are
present, we resbice.

2. cum temtor pugnarent, tamen nr'rn vicerunt, though
they fought braoely‚ yet they did not conquer.

48. Observe that the subjunctive is translated
as if it were indicative.

THE RELATIVE OF PURPOSE.

49. We may say in Latin : -

1. Legati missi sunt ut picem peterent
2. Legati missi sumt qui picem peterent ’

The translation is the same : —
deputz'cs were sent to suefor peace.

50. The relative may be used to denote purpose,
and, with the following subjunctive, may be trans·
lated by the infinitive.
