In Latin there is a special form ior each person,
both in the singular and the plural, therefore the
pronoun need not be used.

amo, I leve,· amis, you love,· amat, he loves.

All nouns areos the third person; ii, therefore, a noun
is used, the verb will be in the third person.

aves cantant, birds sing.

8. Actions differ also in the time in which they
are done3 they may be present, past, or future. In
, English, to express this difference, we use other
verbs, called auxiliaey or helping verbs, though there
is also a special form for past time.

PRESENT. J love, am leving, or de love.
PAsv. I was leving, used to love, did love, loved.
FUTURE. I shall love.

ln Latin there are special tense-forms to express
these differences of time.

PRESENT. amo, I love, am leving, or do love.

Pnsv. amabam, J was leving, used to love, did
love, leved.

FUTURE. ama'ibr'i, I shall love.

To give these special tense-forms is called conju-
gating a verb.

In Latin the present is often used of a past act,
as in English, for the sake of greater vividness.
