NOTE TO RE VISED EDITION. v

The need ol putting some easy Latin into the hands of

pupils very early in their study, to aesompany and sup·

plement the learning of forms and the elements of syntax,
is now happily coming to be realized, and it is hoped
that The New Gradatim will be found to supply exactly
that want.

The Stories of the Argonauts and ot Ulysses‚ abound·
ing as they do in the words, idioms‚ and constructions
ol Caesars Gallic War‚ ought to make it easy for the
pupil to pass from thern to The Gatc to Caesar,· but it
will generally be better to interpose not a little easy and
rapid reading for the sake of an enlarged vocabulary.
