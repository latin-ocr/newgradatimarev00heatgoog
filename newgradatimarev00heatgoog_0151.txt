NOTES. 139

123. l. 8. doctus est: ie, Jason.
l. 9. sublatis ancoris: wergrbing anchor. Read the following
note on tlte Ablative Absolute :
(1) A very common construction in Latin is that of
a noun and a participle in the ablative, to ex-
press the time, cause, or some other circum-
stance of an action. The words in the ablative
are cut off grammatically from the rest oi tlte
sentence, and hence this construction is called
the ablatiue absolute.

consul, pice facti, revertit: the consul,

peace leaving been made, returned.
(2) It is seldom best to render the ablative absolute

literally. Thus instead of the above, we may y

render
1. Τ be consul, aster making peace, returned.
2. T lee consul, when peace lead been made,
returned.
3. T lte consul, because peace bad been made,
returned. .
4. T he consul made peace and returned
(3) Sometimes instead of a noun and a participle in
the ablative we have
1. Two nouns.
2. A pronoun and a participle.
3. A noun and an adjective.

l. 14. antequam. . . concurrerent: the imperfect and pluper-
fect tenses are usually in the subjunctive aiter ante-
quam and priusquam, but the subjunctive is generally
to be rendered as it it were indicative.

124. l. 4. contulerunt: from confero.
Α l. 7. negabat . . . esse: ci. 120,1. 12, and note.

l. 9. iriditirrum: esse omitted, as often with forms made up
of a participle and esse.

l. ro. si . . . perfecisset: see 122, l. 9, and note.

l. 12. iungendi erunt: were to be yeked.

125. l. 4. eti consilio: see 123, l. 4, and note.
