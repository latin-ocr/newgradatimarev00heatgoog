40 THE RELA TI VE.

lt there were no relative, we should have to say,

videii mrimm et Balbus eum mt'uum aedificivit, I see the
wall and Balbus built that wall.

Thus it has also the force of a conjunction and serves
to connect sentences.

Rure 9. -The Relative agrees with its antecedent
in gender, number, and person.

1. ηδι, qui lert& sumus, piigniblmue. we, who are breve,
will fight.
2. tfi, quae parva ee puella, nutricem amis, you, who are
' a little girl, love the nurse.

Rure 10. -The Relative is not necessarily in the
same case as its antecedent, but in the case which
its antecedent would be in if repeated.

1. babis asinum qui (amus) est laboris patiens you have
an ass which is patient of labor.

. ’2. equus quem (equum) habimus est celer, the horse which

we have is fast.

3. virum oritus (viri) tillus es mimus we love the man
whose son you are.

4. hic eet puer cui(pu015) poma dedimus. this is the loy to
whom we gave the apples.

ς. hasta qui (hasti) hostem occidisti erat ionia the spear
with which you killed the enemy was sharp.

(b) A sentence containing a relative word is often
called an adjectival clause, because it qualifies a
substantive like an adjective.

est mihi minen quae eit nigra, l have a llach table.
