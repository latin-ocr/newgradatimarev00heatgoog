ACTIVE AND PASSIVE. 41

Α relative clause may be omitted without altering the
construction of any other word in the sentence.

(c) A relative word is often omitted in English
but never in Latin.

ubl est ea mensa quam heri vidi? where is the table I saw
yestcrday?

(d) The relative always comes first in its own
clause (except after prepositions)‚ and generally
next to the word it qualifies.

Relative words are-

qui, willa quantus
quo, qui, unde, nbt

ncs1vn 'nno Pnss1vn.

‘25. The Verb has two voices—¹ .

(1) Aelim, when you do something3
(2) passive, when something is done to you.

In turning a sentence from an active into a
’ passive form

accusative becomes nominative.
nominative becomes ablativo.

All other cases remain unchanged.

inseres Manlium ὅ somno excitivenmt, geete wake

. Manlius from sleep.
Manlius ὅ somno inseflbus excite'rtus est, Manlius

was wakened from sleep by geesc.
