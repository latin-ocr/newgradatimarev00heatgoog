ORDER. ll

16. The ablative'case generally qualifies a verb
like an adverb, and answers the questions, how?
why? when? where?

He slew him, with a swerd, from hatred, at night,
in tlte street.

OBS. 1.— The conjunction -que‚ and, cannot stand by
itself, but is joined to the end of the word to which it
belongs

pueri puellaeque. pueri et puellae

OBs. 2.- Latin has no article 3 therefore in translating
a noun think whether you ought to put in a or the before
it or not.

0133. 3.—The possessive pronouns my, his, their, etc,
are often left out in Latin.

servi videbant dominum, tlte slaves saw their master.

ORDER.

17. ⁹ English, having so few case-endings, is tied
down to a particular order of words.

The man swallowed the fish
is different from
The fish swallowed the man.

Latin has'much more freedom.

homo devoravit piscem,
piscem homo devoravit,
piscem devoravit homo,
devoravit piscem homo,

all mean, “The man swallowed the fish.”
