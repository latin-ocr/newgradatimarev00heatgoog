DECLENSION.

4. Nouus arethe Names of Things.
In English wexsay,—

The wasp killed the bee.
The bec ,killed the wasp.

In these sentences the words “wasp'' and “hee’'
are unchanged; though in one the “wasp” does
the action, and the “bec’' suffers the action. In
the other the opposite is true. The order only has '
been altered.

In Latin this difference is expressed‚ not by alter-
ing the order, but by changes in the form oi the

word called case-endings.

N onnnnnvn. vespa apia. when the wasp or the bee
does the action.

Accusnnvn. vespam. apem, when the wasp or the
bee suffers the action.

vespa apem necavit„ T lte wasp killed the bec.
vespam apn necavit„ T he bec killed tlte wasp.

Pronouns are the only words in English which have
different forms ior nominative and accusative.

Non. l; who.
Ace. me; whom.
